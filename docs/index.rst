Welcome to cubie's documentation!
====================================

cubie is a Python library designed to provide an easy entry point for users to perform likelihood-free Monte Carlo parameter estimation. The library includes a set of forward-simulating ODE solvers designed to integrate large batches of IVPs from different initial values or with different parameters, all accelerated using CUDA through Numba.
