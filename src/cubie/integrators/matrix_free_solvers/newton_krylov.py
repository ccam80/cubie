    """Create a Newton-Krylov solver device function.

    Parameters
    ----------
    residual_function : callable
        Device function evaluating the nonlinear residual ``F(state)``.
    linear_solver : callable
        Device function solving ``J x = rhs`` for ``x``.
    n : int
        Size of 1d system state/rhs vector
    tolerance : float
        Residual norm required for convergence.
    max_iters : int
        Maximum number of Newton iterations.
    damping : float, optional
        Step shrink factor used during backtracking, default ``0.5``.
    max_backtracks : int, optional
        Maximum number of damping attempts.
    precision : np.float32 or np.float64, optional
        Floating-point data type to use. Default is np.float32.

    Returns
    -------
    callable
        CUDA device function implementing a damped Newton-Krylov method.

    Notes on return code
    --------------------
    The device function returns an int status whose lower 16 bits encode the
    outcome code:
      0: success
      1: no suitable step found (backtracking failed)
      2: max Newton iterations exceeded
      3: inner linear solver did not converge (propagated)
    The upper 16 bits contain the number of Newton iterations completed.

        Parameters
        ----------
        state: device array
            On entry, the initial guess; on exit, the solution if

        parameters: device array

            Timestep size (if applicable).
        a_ij: float
            stage weight (if multi-stage; set to 1.0 for single-stage).
        base_state: device array
            Base state for residual evaluation (e.g., previous step y_n).
        delta: device array
            Workspace for Newton step.
        residual: device array
            Workspace for residual evaluation.
        preconditioned_vec: device array

        Notes
        -----
        - Scratch space required: 4*n where n = len(state).
        - The linear solver is expected to solve J*delta = rhs where rhs
          is provided in-place in the residual array, and delta is used
          as an initial guess and returns the solution in-place.
        - The state is updated in-place and reverted if no acceptable step found.
