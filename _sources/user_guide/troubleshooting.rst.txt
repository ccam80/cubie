Troubleshooting
===============

CUDA Not Found
--------------

**Symptom:** ``CudaSupportError`` or "CUDA toolkit not found".

**Fix:**

1. Verify an NVIDIA GPU is present: ``nvidia-smi``.
2. Install the CUDA 12 toolkit and ensure ``nvcc`` is on your PATH.
3. Install the correct Numba CUDA package:
   ``pip install numba-cuda[cu12]``.

"Low Occupancy" Warnings
-------------------------

Numba may warn about low occupancy when shared memory usage is high.
This is informational, not an error.  CuBIE is designed to work at low
occupancy for large ODE systems.  Performance is still dominated by the
batch size.

Newton Solver Not Converging
-----------------------------

If an implicit algorithm reports many failed trajectories or slow
convergence:

1. **Tighten tolerances.** Try ``atol=1e-8, rtol=1e-6`` to give the
   solver more room.
2. **Increase the preconditioner order.** Higher Neumann-series orders
   improve Krylov convergence at some compute cost.
3. **Reduce the initial step size.** A large first step can push the
   Newton iteration far from convergence.
4. **Try a different algorithm.** Rosenbrock-W methods avoid Newton
   iteration entirely; FIRK methods are more robust than DIRK for very
   stiff problems.
5. **Check the equations.** Singular or near-singular Jacobians can
   prevent convergence.

Out of VRAM
------------

**Symptom:** ``CudaAPIError`` with an out-of-memory message.

**Fixes:**

- Reduce output: save fewer variables, use summaries instead of
  time-domain data.
- Enable automatic chunking (it should trigger automatically, but verify
  ``mem_proportion`` is not set too high).
- Switch to CuPy memory pools for better memory reuse
  (``memory_settings={"allocator": "cupy"}``).
- Reduce the batch size.

CUDASIM Mode
------------

For CPU-only debugging, set the environment variable *before* importing
CuBIE:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Bash
   export NUMBA_ENABLE_CUDASIM=1

   # PowerShell
   $env:NUMBA_ENABLE_CUDASIM = "1"

CUDASIM runs the CUDA kernels on the CPU in a single thread.  It is
orders of magnitude slower than GPU execution but does not require a GPU.
Useful for debugging logic errors and running in CI environments without
GPUs.

.. note::

   Never set ``NUMBA_ENABLE_CUDASIM`` inside Python code.  It must be
   set before the ``numba`` module is imported.

Common Attrs Validation Errors
------------------------------

CuBIE uses ``attrs`` classes for configuration.  Common mistakes:

- **Wrong type:** passing a Python ``float`` where a NumPy float is
  expected, or vice versa.  CuBIE's validators are tolerant of NumPy
  dtypes, but passing a string where a number is expected will raise
  ``TypeError``.
- **Negative tolerance:** ``atol`` and ``rtol`` must be positive.
- **Step size bounds:** ``dt_min`` must be less than ``dt_max``, and
  ``dt`` must be between them.
